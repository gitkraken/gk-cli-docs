### Unix / Ubuntu

### Snap

#### Downloadable Binary

`gk` is available as a downloadable binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/gitkraken/gk-cli/releases/latest). Once you have it, add it to your binaries folder:

```
mv ~/Downloads/gk /usr/local/bin/gk
``` 

Or create a new directory, move the binary and add it to $PATH:
```
mkdir "$HOME/cli"
mv ~/Downloads/gk "$HOME/cli"
export PATH="$HOME/gk:$PATH"
``` 

You can also [download](https://github.com/gitkraken/gk-cli/releases/latest) your corresponding package (`.deb`, `.rpm`) and install it with:

```
sudo apt install ./gk.deb
```

or 

```
sudo rpm -i ./gk.rpm
```

### Windows

`gk` is available from [Winget](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli) with the following command:

```
winget install gitkraken.cli
```

#### Downloadable Binary

Download the binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/gitkraken/gk-cli/releases/latest) and place the `gk.exe` in a desired folder. Then edit your environment variables to add it to your PATH.

1. In Search, search for **Environment Variables**.
2. Click on the **Edit the system environment variables** result.
3. In the modal, click on the **Environment Variables...** button.
4. In the **System Variables** section, scroll until you find the **PATH** variable. Click on it.
    - If it doesn't exist, create a variable with the name **PATH**. 
5. Add the path to the `gk` binary at the end.

## Troubleshooting

### gk from Oh-My-Zsh

Oh-My-Zsh has ```gitk``` aliased as ```gk``` and that can create some problems. To fix this, type in your terminal:

```
unalias gk
```
